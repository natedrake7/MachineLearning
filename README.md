Here reside three projects which are written in jupyter notebooks in Python.
The first is an implementation of Gradient Descent,along with some analytical solutions (of the background work done by some basic numpy
functions).
The second is the implementation of a face recognition algorithm which uses PCA to lower the dimension size of the input data,
and k means to classify and finally create a reconstructed image.
The third and last is the implementation of 2 Neural Networks,a feedforward and a convolutional.The feedforward uses mfccs signals from
music sounds to detect the music genre.The convolutional uses melgrams,and also supports the ability to convert youtube songs to melgrams in order
to identify their music genre.
